        <h2 id="Introduction"><u>Introduction</u></h2>

        <p>This essay will examine how IDEO a design company IDEO and how they worked with SimpliSafe, a security company to change the face of home security. Simplisafe are a US based home security company that offer security measures such as cameras, sensors, alarms, keypad and much more. This essay will explore how IDEO approached the design and how it fitted in with the needs of SimpliSafe. The main focus of this essay will be to demonstrate how IDEO transformed home security for SimpliSafe. It will examine what SimpliSafe’s products looked like before working with IDEO and IDEO changed the way they looked. It will demonstrate how IDEO changed home security for the better.</p>

        <p>IIDEO, a global design company established in 1991 and is committed to creating a positive impact on design. They employ over 700+ employees and have 9 different locations around the world in London, New York, Shanghai, Munich and more. They have 23+ design capabilities in different sectors, branding, digital, energy and environment. In 1980, while working with Apple on a new computer, they created the first manufacturable mouse. They have also worked on different branding and design products for companies like RightRice and Ascensia Diabetes Care.</p>

        <p>SimpliSafe is an American home security company that was founded in 2006 based in Boston USA. They manufacture and sell self-installed security systems that connect to a central monitoring center. Their system includes doorbells with cameras, motion sensors, smoke detectors, alarms and a keypad to active and deactivate the alarm system. The SimpliSafe bas unit can support up to 41 different sensors. In January 2018 they unveiled the third generation of the system where they partnered with IDEO to redesign their system. The updated version, which was smaller in size had the ability to work with WIFI which doubled the range of the device. </p>

        <div class="simplisafe_product">
            <img src="img/Simplisafeproduct.png" alt="SimpliSafe logo" title="SimpliSafe logo">

        </div>

        <p>In the USA about 20% of homes are protected by security systems and many homeowners only ever install these after they have been broken into. SimpliSafe decided to try and reach out to the rest of the US to try and encourage them to invest in a SimpliSafe system to prevent break ins happening. In order to achieve this SimpliSafe decided to contact IDEO to simplify the product to create a smaller but more powerful product to reach a wider homeowner audience to help them feel safe in their home.</p>

        <p> To produce an effective design that worked for the people, IDEO firstly needed to identify what worked but more importantly what needed improvement on the third-generation version. IDEO asked a number of participants to use the product and offer feedback on their user experience. Additionally, it was felt that the system should respond to the certain users’ needs and be unobtrusive. It should react appropriately to any emergency, but it should still protect your privacy.</p>

        <blockquote>- We think of design as a security feature, so we partnered with IDEO to make SimpliSafe something our customers would love interacting with every day. If people love using the system, they’ll be safer as a result.</blockquote>

        <cite>- Chad Laurans the founder and CEO of Simplisafe (2017)</cite>

        <br>
        <br>


        <p>This is important, if you have a sleek well-designed product that is interactive and easy to use people will want to use it more.</p>

        <blockquote>- Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it’s this veneer – that the designers are handed this box and told, “Make it look good!” That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.</blockquote>

        <cite>- Steve jobs</cite>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>For example, current smart phones have slick GUI’s (Graphical User Interfaces) that allow the user easy interaction with the applications. This is why it is so important that designers get the design of a product right so that customers get the best product possible product and it sells. The importance of design cannot be underestimated when creating new products in order to create the best possible product.</p>

        <blockquote> - To design is much more than simply to assemble, to order, or even to edit; it is to add value and meaning, to illuminate, to simplify, to clarify, to modify, to dignify, to dramatize, to persuade, and perhaps even to amuse.</blockquote>

        <h2 id="IDEO's-Design"><u>IDEO’S Design</u></h2>

        <p>After engaging with many potential customers IDEO looked at SimpliSafe’s original design. (see figure 1). They completely revamped many of their products including a wireless touch to wake keypad, easily installed sensors, a home base that controls the whole system like a brain. (see figure 2). They also design SimpliSafe’s first video doorbell that can be used alongside the security system, (see figure 3) By making the security system more appealing to everyone they are more likely to use it more and to use it correctly. Figure 3 displays the design of the doorbell with a built-in camera from the perspective of a visitor. Attention is focused on the button due to the scale of it and the blue light surrounding it.</p>

        </div>

        <p>When designing the different products for SimpliSafe, IDEO were consistent in their design approach enabling users to engage with the products in an intuitive manner. For example, the glass break sensor, Figure 4 looks like a human ear drum that will actually hear a window breaking. Here, they reduced the size of the sensors by four times but improved the range and the battery life. The sensors are designed in such a way that they visually blend into your home so that they do not look out of place and are invisible to any intruders. The sensors can also identify between a window that is left open to a window that has been broken. The integrated keypad will inform the homeowner when a window has been left open, but importantly will alert the police when a window has been deliberately broken.</p>

        </div>

        <p>With the new base station that acts as the brains of the whole system is integrated with the amazon Alexa and it allows you to ask Alexa to activate the security system either in home or away mode. All you have to do is simply tell Alexa that you are heading out for the day whether it be to work or just out and Alexa will take care of everything. When it comes time to be going to bed you can simply tell Alexa goodnight and the system will go into home mode making the user feel safe a night.</p>

        <p>The new SimpliSafe keypad and base station guide you through an easy set up guide with voice feedback and a soft LED light that lets the user know that the system is set up and armed correctly. The new system comes with many layers of backup, so users don’t have to worry if the power or the internet goes off. The intelligent system is tailored to the way that it reacts to different situations. For example, if a window is left open then the user will get a gentle reminder but will get a police response if a window has been smashed. There is also an option where families can opt out of being recorded at home to give them privacy and peace of mind. The new redesigned SimpliSafe system was launched in 2018 and it replaced the two previous systems with the same price.</p>

        <p>Cnet gave SimpliSafe 4 out of 5 stars, they said it is one of the most affordable home security systems on the market with the easiest setup and to use. They carried out tests on the various sensors and they all came back positive. The redesigned product looks better than ever. They had a few bad comments about it the devices, they said that the camera was not their favourite and that the glass break sensor only worked when the sensitivity was up full. Overall Cnet like the device as they said it has good coverage and is priced at a great value.</p>

        <p>The web magazine PCMag carried out a test on the new SimpliSafe product and received good feedback as it received an:</p>

        <h2 id="Conclusion"><u>Conclusion</u></h2>

        <p>IDEO worked with SimpliSafe and created a new home security system and redesigned the way home security looks and is used in the home. They redesigned everything from cameras, sensors, alarms, keypad and much more. IDEO created a new device that was slimmer, sleeker, easier to use and looks better in the home that helped IDEO and SimpliSafe revolutionise home security. IDEO took an old, clunky looking security system and turned it into something and turned it into something new and exciting for the world of home security systems </p>
